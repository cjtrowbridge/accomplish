# goals
A tool to track my goals and stay up on news.

The goal here is to learn Bootstrap 4 now that it is out, as well as creating a "vision board" as inspired by a recent aquaintance who is a passionate believer in the movie "The Secret." I do not subscribe to the mystical conclusions posited in the movie, but one idea really stuck with me, which was that if you focus on a list of goals multiple times every day, you are more likely to accomplish them. They would say it's magic, I would say it's just because the goals stay fresh in your mind.

This project will feature a grid system with two columns. 

The first, smaller column will show several RSS feeds aggregated by my other project "Agrogator" which is on my Github profile if you want to check it out. 

The larger column will show several lists of goals, delineated by time-horizon and seperated into columns by broad categories.
