# goals
A tool to track my goals.

The goal here is to learn Bootstrap 4 now that it is out, as well as creating a "vision board" as inspired by a recent aquaintance who is a passionate believer in the movie "The Secret." I do not subscribe to the mystical conclusions posited in the movie, but one idea really stuck with me, which was that if you focus on a list of goals multiple times every day, you are more likely to accomplish them. They would say it's magic, I would say it's just because the goals stay fresh in your mind.

This project will feature a grid system with several columns for different time horizons.
